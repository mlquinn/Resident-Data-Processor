# Resident-Data-Processor
This is a three part program which collects data about local residents and then converts the data to XML for processing.

# Resident Data Collector
This script takes user input to collect data about residents in the area and saves the information into a .txt file.

# Resident Data Formatter
This script takes the resulting .txt file from Resident Data Collector and formats the data into an XML file for easier data processing.

# Resident Data Processor
This script takes the XML file from Resident Data Formatter and parses through the information to determine things about the residents such as student status and the average ages of students and non students. 

# Resident.CSS
This is the stylesheet for the XML for easier viewing in a browser for manual data processing or verification of data form factors.
